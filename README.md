# petproject_bootstrap
Petproject
This is the "Task_Manager" petproject.
The idea is that by selecting a character, the user receives a list of tasks (each character has its own separate list)
For the first time I used the Bootstrap framework (logo, slider, menu, cards).
In the future, it is planned to add a couple of html pages and use Python to work out all the logic.
